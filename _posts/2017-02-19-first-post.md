I have re-misarranged this site into a simple tech blog. Perhaps in the future
it will become more.  But for now, posts on software development it is. This
site continues to run jekyll, but now using github pages. And the site is now
formatted so that its readable on phones and tablets.  The last design was
circa 2010 and was not at all suitable for the way people consume the web these
days. That's all. I just wanted to put up a short post to get something up 
here. More to come...
